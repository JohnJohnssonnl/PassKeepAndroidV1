# PassKeep Android Version (use at your own risk)<BR><BR>
BUILD: start Visual Studio 2015/2017, make sure you have Xamarin added and start the solution and make sure the startup project points to the android app instead of the DLL project, and press BUILD, yep, that's it, no required extra nonsense<BR><BR>
This is my practical lab test environment to store and read data encrypted (in this case a pass), based on a encrypt/decrypt key + cryptography such as ED25519 with added PBKDF2 iteration encryption (user decides the number of iterations, each value results in a totally different result). It anonimes the website you store (ED25519) and encrypts the pass for that website with cryptography (in this test Rijndael). This encrypted combination is stored under an anonym bin file and can be read again by using the decryption key and returns your pass for that website if you earlier stored it. For example a website 12345 is stored as "dC8Mcccx9CobL8RcwQhPGcByKFpNP2A3CK7xqRUmi8P4.bin".<BR><BR> I tested it on Android 4.4 and 8.1.
